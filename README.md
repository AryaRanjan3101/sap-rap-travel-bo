### Repository Description

This repository demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Business Object (BO)** using **ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)** with **Core Data Services (CDS)**, transactional behavior definitions, and OData service exposure. The project focuses on a **Travel and Booking Management scenario**, which serves as a practical example to understand how BOs are modeled, projected, and exposed as services in modern SAP S/4HANA environments.

At the core of the project lies the definition of **root view entities and projection views** for both Travel and Booking objects. These CDS artifacts represent the semantic data model and define how the underlying database tables are exposed to the RAP framework. Using annotations such as `@ObjectModel`, `@Consumption`, `@Semantics`, and `@Search`, the entities are enriched with metadata to provide value helps, text associations, search capabilities, and currency handling.

The repository also illustrates the significance of **Business Objects in RAP**. A BO encapsulates the business logic, transactional consistency, and data integrity by defining root entities, compositions, and associations. The **Travel BO** is the root entity, with **Booking** modeled as a composition child. This hierarchical setup reflects real-world business processes and ensures that CRUD operations remain consistent across related entities.

In addition to CDS modeling, the project includes **Service Definition** and **Service Binding** artifacts. The service definition specifies which entities of the BO should be exposed, while the service binding publishes them as an OData V4 service. This allows seamless integration with **SAP Fiori applications** or any external consumer via standardized APIs.

Key aspects covered in this repository:

* Root View Entity vs. Projection View Entity
* Composition and association in BO modeling
* Value help definitions and search annotations
* Currency and amount semantics
* Service definition and binding for OData exposure
* Transactional consistency with RAP BOs

This repository is an ideal starting point for developers who want to learn **ABAP RAP, CDS views, OData services, and modern BO design**. It can also serve as a reference for implementing real-world scenarios in SAP S/4HANA projects.
